## Core Claims
- The legislation, already cleared by the Lok Sabha, was tabled for consideration and passage by Union Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw.Vaishnaw described the bill as a crucial step to regulate the rapidly growing sector, encourage innovation, and address risks associated with money-based gaming.The bill seeks to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for the online gaming industry, with the twin objectives of promoting growth and protecting youth and vulnerable groups from the social, economic, psychological, and privacy-related harms of such games.The legislation proposes the creation of a central regulatory body to oversee four key segments: esports, educational games, social gaming, and real money gaming.Among these, real money gaming platforms — such as poker and fantasy sports — face the biggest blow.The Bill’s “Prohibitions” clause states: “No person shall offer, aid, abet, induce or otherwise indulge or engage in the offering of online money game and online money gaming service.” It further bans banks and financial institutions from processing transactions for such platforms.Under the “Offences and Penalties” clause, service providers found offering real money games could face up to three years’ imprisonment or fines of up to Rs 1 crore.
- Dream11, India’s team sponsor, pays approximately Rs 358 crore, while My11Circle holds IPL fantasy rights worth Rs 625 crore over five years.
- Advertising such platforms could also invite jail terms of up to two years or fines of Rs 50 lakh.The government defended the move, citing widespread social and financial harms: “The proliferation of online money games…offering monetary returns against user deposits has led to serious social, financial, psychological and public health harms, particularly among young individuals and economically disadvantaged groups.”Cricket, which has seen a surge in real money gaming sponsorships, stands to be most affected.
- Fan engagement will also be affected.” He added that fantasy apps might shift to subscription-based models, though revenues will likely fall.For the esports fraternity, however, the Bill is being hailed as a breakthrough.
